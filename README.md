# DeepNN_LowDoseCT_TensforFlow
Deep neural netowrk architecture consists of eight convolutional layers and PReLU activation function in order to map low-dose CT images to high-dose CT images.
Make sure you have Python 3 and Tensorflow installed.
Easiest way in Windows is to install Anaconda and install tensorflow on condo virtual env.
Pydicom library is used. (pip install Pydicom for importing dicom images)
